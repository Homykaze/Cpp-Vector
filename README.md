# Implemented my own version of an STL class 'vector'
After getting to know the mere basics of the Standard Template Library in C++, and the main principles of object-oriented programming, I decided to implement my own version of the 'vector' class called 'vectorOfInt'. It is limited to store only integers, but it is capable to output the size of a vector, set values at an index of an instance of the class, it is possible to resize this 'vectorOfInt' to a certain size as well as to push an element to its front or back.

Furthermore, there are 3 constructors implemented for this data structure, such as: no argument constructor, constructor with an argument to set the size of the 'vectorOfint', and a copy constructor, to be able to instantiate a new object upon copying another instance. A destructor is also implemented to deallocate memory whenever an instance of this class is out of the scope of the running program.
